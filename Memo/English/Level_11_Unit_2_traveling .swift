 I've finally decided where I'm going on vacation this summer.
 
 SUE
 Really? Where?
 
 TED
 Japan! I've made up my mind. Now I just need your help with my itinerary. I know you've been there a few times for business.
 
 SUE
 Yes, and it's a great place to visit. What do you want to see? Temples? Gardens? Cities? The countryside?
 
 TED
 Cities, temples and shopping areas. I'm hoping to spend some time in Tokyo, but most of my time in Kyoto.
 
 SUE
 That's a good plan. How long will you be there?
 
 TED
 I'll have five days there.
 
 SUE
 Just five days? Are you crazy? It would be a good idea to spend at least seven days there.
 
 TED
 Hmm. I'll consider it. So, if I have a week there, how much time should I spend in each city?
 
 SUE
 I recommend three days in Tokyo. You can see the famous temples, visit a museum and go to the main shopping areas. If I were you, I'd spend the rest of the time in Kyoto. It's a smaller city, and you'll get a feel for the more traditional Japan.
 
 TED
 Great idea. I'll work on my itinerary and send it to you in a few days.
 
 SUE
 Sure. Glad to help you.
 
 TED
 Thanks!

 A: We've rebooked you on the same flight tomorrow.
 
 我们已经给您重新定了明天的同一航班。
 B: That won't work. I have to be there tomorrow morning.

 A: OK. I have a couple of options that get you there tomorrow morning.
 
 好的。我们有几个选择可以让您明天早上到达那里。
 B: Great. What are they?
 
 太好了。它们是什么？
 
 
 在结束对话前一定要确认信息，并要求把更换后的航班信息发邮件给你或者换新的登机牌。

 Tips for flying
 
 If you fly anywhere these days, you have probably experienced the unfortunate situation of a canceled flight. Here are some tips on how to deal with this increasingly common airline experience.
 
 1. Plan ahead. If possible, try to fly nonstop.
 
 2. Fly early in the day. If your flight is canceled or delayed, you have more options for being rebooked on a later flight. If you are on one of the last flights of the day, you will be in trouble if that flight is canceled.
 
 3. Pack lightly. If possible, just have carry-on baggage. It's much easier to reschedule a flight if you haven't checked bags.
 
 4. Have your airline phone numbers stored on your cellphone. This is very important because the first thing you want to do when you hear your flight has been canceled is to call the airline immediately. Of course, everyone else will also be calling, so expect to be placed on hold. If your flight is canceled due to inclement weather, many flights may also be canceled, and the call center representatives will be flooded with calls. But if you are placed on hold, just wait patiently.
 
 5. Get in line to rebook, as suggested by the airline, but stay online with the airline call center. Talk with whomever can take care of you first. Also, some airports have special kiosks for self-service rebooking.
 
 6. Be polite to the ticket agent or call center agent. Your problem isn't the fault of that person. You can even say something like 'I know it's not your fault, but I'm not happy right now because …' Rude or demanding passengers will likely end up with less. This is a situation where politeness can make all of the difference.
 
 7. Regulations about what airlines are required to offer customers vary widely. However, in general, if the situation is beyond the airline's control (weather, air-traffic delays), you probably won't be offered compensation or assistance. If the situation is within the airline's control (maintenance problem, lack of a flight crew), you probably will be given some compensation, like meal or hotel vouchers. Remember, though, it never hurts to ask for assistance, as long as you ask politely.

 一个城市的积极特   世界级城市有很多吸引人的特征，你会想把它们写进来。
 
 Paris has magnificent architecture.
 巴黎有宏伟的建筑。
 
 San Francisco has stunning views of the bay and hills.    旧金山有绝妙的海湾景色和山景。
 
 Singapore has so much cultural diversity.
 新加坡有众多不同的文化。
 
 Rome has amazing ancient monuments.
 罗马有令人惊奇的古代建筑。
 
 Shanghai has a vibrant art scene.
 上海有鲜活的艺术生活。
 
 
 一个城市的消极特征
 
 不幸的是，大的城镇地区常常有严重的社会和经济问题。
 
 Unemployment is really high in Chicago.
 芝加哥的失业率非常高。

 Tampa has a terrible problem with homelessness.
 在坦帕无家可归是个严重的问题。
 
 There is a lot of crime in most huge cities.
 在大多数巨大城市中都有很多犯罪。
 
 I hate seeing trash on the streets of my city.
 我憎恨看到我的城市街道上的垃圾。
 
 变换语序加强语气
 
 有时说话人和作者希望把注意力集中在某件事或某个观点上。一种方法是变换语序。在有些语法书中，这被称为 cleft sentence（分裂句）。请看以下各例：
 
 以 'what' 起句
 
 比较这两个句子。注意第二个句子中重点在单词love上，而且它以单词what开始。
 
 I love looking at modern architecture.
 我爱看现代建筑。
 
 What I love is looking at modern architecture.
 我爱的事情是看现代建筑。
 
 
 这些句子虽然复杂，但在英语中很常见。它们是强调句中某一特定部分的好办法。请看下面两对句子，一个是常规句，一个是变换语序后的句子，比较它们的强调程度。
 
 It is interesting how the city has changed.
 城市的变化是有意思的。
 
 What is interesting is how the city has changed.
 有意思的是城市是如何变化的。
 
 I like the efficient subways in Tokyo.
 我喜欢东京的有效率的地铁。
 
 
 What I like about Tokyo is the efficient subways.
 我喜欢东京的地方是它的有效率的地铁。
 
 I'm interested in shopping.
 我对购物感兴趣。
 
 What I'm interested in is shopping.
 我感兴趣的是购物。
 
 描述一个城市
 
 一种描写一个有意思的城市的方法是使用各种描述性词语来表达你的感情。注意-ing和-ed结尾的词。以-ing结尾的词常常描述某个事物的特性，但是以-ed结尾的词描述感情。
 
 The homelessness in Tampa was shocking.
 在坦帕无家可归的情形是令人震惊的。
 
 I was shocked by the homelessness in Tampa.
 我对坦帕的无家可归的情形感到震惊。
 
 这些是几对描述性词汇。
 
 disgusted – disgusting 感到恶心的－令人恶心的
 
 amazed – amazing 感到十分惊奇的－令人十分惊奇的
 
 disturbed – disturbing 感到不安的－令人感到不安的
 
 confused – confusing 感到疑惑的－令人感到疑惑的
 
 surprised – surprising 感到惊讶的－令人感到惊讶的
 
 弱化负面评论
 
 你不知道谁会读你的博客文章，因此如果你要说一些关于某人的城市负面的事情，你要做到diplomatic（圆通得体的）。一种方法是用复句开场来弱化你的观点。
 
 I hate to say it, but homelessness is a problem there.
 我不太想说，可是无家可归是那的一个问题。
 
 I don't want to offend anyone, but crime was a problem there.
 我不想得罪任何人，但是犯罪是那的一个问题。
 
 I'm sorry to say this, but it was disgusting.
 我很难过说到这事，但是它是令人恶心的。
 
 另一个弱化负面观点的方法是使用像a little或者a bit的量词。

 It was a little disgusting.
 它有一点令人恶心。

 She was a bit disturbed.
 她有一点感到不安。
